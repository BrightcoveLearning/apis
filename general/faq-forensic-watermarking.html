          <summary style="font-size: 1rem;">How does content detection work?</summary>
          <p>The detection process is based on a portion of the content that is able to be downloaded, captured, or recorded into a file. A specific tool from NAGRA, called <strong>Packager</strong>, generates a <strong>.pak</strong> file. This file is submitted to NAGRA to retrieve the unique sequence delivered, which is then matched to a user. The customer is responsible for matching the sequence to the user. Detection services are acquired directly with NAGRA; usually done by a 3rd party hired by the content owner to crawl the internet to find illegal content.</p>
