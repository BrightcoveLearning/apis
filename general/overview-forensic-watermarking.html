    <h2 id="Video_Cloud_Studio">Video Cloud Studio</h2>
    <p>Follow these steps to use Forensic Watermarking with Video Cloud Studio:</p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist-restart">
      <li>Create an ingest profile that uses Forensic Watermarking.</li>
      <li>Provide Brightcove with your Nagra License Key. This License Key will be used during transcoding to generate the watermark.</li>
      <li>
        Ingest or re-transcode your videos that you want to watermark.
        <ol>
          <li>In the <strong>Upload</strong> module, select <strong>Enable Forensic Watermark</strong></li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>In the <strong>Media</strong> module, you can enable/disable your videos for watermarking.</li>
      <li>
        Configure your player.
        <p>This is where you will pass your watermarking key to the player. You can use either the Brightcove web player or the Native SDK players:</p>
