        <p>If you use <code translate="No">video</code> or <code translate="No">player</code> fields (such a <code translate="No">video</code> , <code translate="No">video_name</code> , <code translate="No">player</code> or player_name ) in the fields to return but do not include them in the <code translate="No">dimensions</code>, the response items will include irrelevant values for those items and should be ignored. Other values in the items will be valid.</p>
        <h3>Workaround</h3>
        <p>Do not include video or player fields in the response fields unless you also include them as <code translate="No">dimensions</code>.</p>

      <h2 id="other_results_for_device_manufacturer">"Other" results for device manufacturer</h2>
        <p>In some cases, you may see a high number of "other" results for the <code translate="No">device_manufacturer</code> field. This occurs when the Data Collector does not recognize the <code translate="No">user_agent</code> delivered to it with analytics data. The most common cause that we have identified for this is a custom <code translate="No">user_agent</code> string created by Instagram, but there are probably others.</p>
