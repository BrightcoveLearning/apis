    <p>You can use Media RSS (MRSS) to have Brightcove pull your content from your own system from an MRSS feed that you publish. Video Cloud pulls the metadata from the MRSS feed and either creates a remote asset or downloads (from where they are hosted) and processes the videos and any associated assets (thumbnails, closed caption files, etc.).</p>
