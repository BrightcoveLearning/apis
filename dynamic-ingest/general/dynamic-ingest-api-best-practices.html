    <p>The <span translate="No">Dynamic Ingest API</span> is powerful and flexible, but to use it most effectively, you need to follow some best practices, which are detailed below.</p>
    </section>

    <h2 id="best_practices">Best practices</h2>
    
    <p>Below are rules and guidelines for Dynamic Ingest.</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>You should&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> have duplicate jobs processing for the same asset. An asset in this instance is defined as a video object, an audio track in a specific language, a text track in a specific language, or a specific image type. Here are some examples to illustrate the point:
    
      <ul>
        <li>UNACCEPTABLE: Submit an ingest request for a video file and then submit another video ingest request with the same Video ID before the first ingest job completes</li>
        <li>ACCEPTABLE: Submit an ingest request for a video file, then submit an ingest request for a text track in English associated with the same Video ID, and then submit an ingest request for a thumbnail image with the same Video ID</li>
        <li>ACCEPTABLE: Submit an ingest job for a text track in English and then submit an ingest request for a text track in Spanish in parallel</li>
        <li>UNACCEPTABLE: Submit a request to ingest a Spanish audio track and then immediately submit a request to ingest another Spanish audio track on the same Video ID</li>
        <li>The <code translate="No">profile </code> field for ingest requests is <strong>optional</strong>. Avoid hard-coding the <code translate="No">profile </code> in apps and integrations - instead, set the most commonly used profile as the <strong>default</strong> for the account, and omit the field, or <a href="/ingest-profiles/references/reference.html#api-Profile-Get_All_Ingest_Profiles">fetch the available profiles for the account</a> and force the user to choose one.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>A 20 request-per-second limit on each account for total requests across <span translate="No">Dynamic Ingest</span> and the <span translate="No">CMS API</span>.</li>
      <li>There is a limit of 100 concurrent normal priority DI jobs per account</li>
      <li>If you are ingesting large batches of files, consider using the <a href="/dynamic-ingest/ingest-guides/dynamic-delivery-ingest-priority-queueing.html">Low Priority queue</a> which will allow you to queue more than 100 jobs.</li>
      <li>Ingest content is normally limited to 100GBs per file (if you need to ingest larger files please contact your Account Manager).</li>
      <li>If you are ingesting files in batches, limit concurrent normal priority jobs to 100 and wait for one job to complete processing before adding another - see <a href="/dynamic-ingest/general/fallback-retry-strategy.html">Fallback / Retry Strategy</a> for more information.</li>
      <li>Validate ingest profile changes to ensure you are getting the results you want before ingesting full batches.</li>
    </ul>
