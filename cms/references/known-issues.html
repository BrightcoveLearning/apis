    <h2 id="original_filename_gets_corrupted">Original filename gets corrupted</h2>
    <p>In some cases, the <code>original_filename</code> field for videos gets corrupted and will not contain the real filename.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Tags_may_not_contain_commas">Tags may not contain commas</h2>
    <p>If you attempt to add a tag to a video that contains a comma (e.g. "SomeCo, Inc") the request will fail with an "illegal tag" error.</p>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="Scheduled_videos">Scheduled videos</h2>
    <p>Because the Playback API and Player Catalog cache videos for up to 10-15 minutes, a player requesting a video scheduled to become available during the next few minutes (up to 20), may not be able to get a playable video until the cache refreshes.</p>
