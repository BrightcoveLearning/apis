This would include: 1) deleting a video and then trying to assign its reference id to another video; 2) attempting to create a new video that fails with a 503 (service unavailable) error and trying the same request again.
        <p>Please wait at least 3 minutes after getting this error before retrying the operation. Note also that if you attempt the create a video with a reference id, and the attempt fails (for reasons unrelated to the reference id), that reference id will be locked for 30 seconds, and repeated attempts to create the video will fail until you wait long enough for the reference id to be unlocked.</p>
