    <p>Labels are similar to tags. You can add them to videos and then use them to search for a group of videos or  but they have some distinct advantages:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Labels are created at the account level, and applied to videos.
        <p>This is important particularly if your purpose is to organize your video library.For example, if you are trying organize your videos using tags, you might create tags like <code>birds</code>, <code>fish</code>, and <code>insects</code>. Then it's easy to search and find all your bird videos and create a smart playlist for them. But if a user adding a new video accidentally types <code>bird</code> instead of <code>birds</code>, you now have a new tag, and the video does not belong to your <code>birds</code> collection.</p>
        <p>If you create a label called <code>birds</code> instead, only that label can be added to a video. You can't accidentally add the non-existent label <code>birds</code> instead.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        Labels are created as hierarchical path, such as <code>/nature/birds/shorebirds</code>.
        <p>This means that you can search (or create a playlist based on) a partial or full path:
          <ul>
            <li><code>q=labels:/nature</code> - returns all videos that have the label <code>nature</code></li>
            <li><code>q=labels:/nature/birds</code> - returns the <code>birds</code> subgroup of the <code>nature</code> videos</li>
            <li><code>q=labels:/nature/birds/shorebirds</code> - returns the <code>shorebirds</code> sub-group of the <code>/nature/birds</code> videos</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>
