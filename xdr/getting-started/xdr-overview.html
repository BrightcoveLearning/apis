    <p>
      Brightcove's cross-device resume (XDR) feature lets you start watching video on one device, pause the video, and continue watching later on another device. When you resume playback, you'll continue watching where you left off. This provides a seamless viewing experience for a piece of content.
    </p>
    <p>
      The XDR service stores user viewing activity, including the most recent play position. This information is used to resume playback on any device.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brightcove's XDR feature:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Integrates with your customer web site and mobile device apps
      </li>
      <li>
        Uses REST-based APIs and native language calls on desktop and mobile devices
      </li>
      <li>
        Works with content stored in your Video Cloud library
      </li>
      <li>
        Retains play position information for 90 days
      </li>
      <li>
        Meets GDPR and COPPA compliance
      </li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note that there is a delay between the submission of XDR data and the availability of that data via the API of up to 30 seconds.</aside>

    <p>This feature allows viewers to start watching on one device, pause it, and continue watching on another device.</p>
    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>As a viewer watches a video, the player continuously records the playhead position of the video being watched. This information is stored in the XDR API.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image--no-border"
        src="/assets/images/xdr/process-flow1.png"
        alt="Record playhead position"
      />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Record playhead position</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>When the viewer resumes watching the video on a different device, the playhead position is retrieved from the XDR API. Playback resumes where the viewer left off.</p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img
        class="bcls-image--no-border"
        src="/assets/images/xdr/process-flow2.png"
        alt="Resume playback"
      />
      <figcaption class="bcls-caption--image">Resume playback</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>Implementation</h3>
    <p>
      To implement cross-device resume, follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol class="bcls-tasklist">
      <li>
        <p>
          Even though viewer data is sent to Brightcove analytics automatically, you need to set the user identifier.
        </p>
        <p>
          The information sent and stored in the XDR API will include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            userID: end-viewer id
          </li>
          <li>
            assetID: video id
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              playhead: position in seconds
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For details about setting the user, see the linked documents in step 3.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Get a viewer's playback position by making a request to the XDR API. You will need a server-side application to make the REST API request for the playback position.
        </p>
        <p>
          The request to the XDR API return the playback position in seconds based on:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            accountID: Video Cloud Account id
          </li>
          <li>
            userID: end-viewer id
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>
              assetID: video id
            </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For details, see the following:
