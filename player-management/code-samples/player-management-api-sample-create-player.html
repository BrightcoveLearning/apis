    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">This sample app is meant as a way for you to explore the basics of the Player Management API. It is not meant to be an enterprise ready, deployable app. For instance, form validation is not exhaustive and passwords are sent NOT using HTTPS.
      <p>To learn about the general approach concerning the architecture of this sample app, specifically authentication and AJAX implementations, see the <a href="https://support.brightcove.com/search?search=search=xmlhttprequest">examples that use HTTPRequest</a>.</p>

    <p>The high-level application logic for this app is as follows:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Gather user data necessary to create a player</li>
      <li>Build the JSON data structure to pass to the API for player creation</li>
      <li>On button click, perform AJAX call to create player</li>
      <li>On AJAX call success perform the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Inject JSON response data into HTML page</li>
          <li>Call function to publish player</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Perform AJAX call to publish player</li>
      <li>On AJAX call success perform the following:
        <ul>
          <li>Inject JSON response data into HTML</li>
          <li>Dynamically build HTML that displays selected player information and inject that into HTML page</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

      <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
        <li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
        <li>Click <strong>Edit on CodePen</strong> in the upper right corner to fork this CodePen into your own account.</li>

    <h2 id="proxy">Proxy code</h2>

    <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
