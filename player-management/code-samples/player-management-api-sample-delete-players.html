    <p>If you need to create a delete players app, you will find the code needed to make this app functional commented out in the JavaScript</p>
    
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--warning">This sample app is meant as a way for you to explore the basics of the Player Management API. It is not meant to be an enterprise ready, deployable app. For instance, form validation is not exhaustive and passwords are sent NOT using HTTPS.

    <p>Here are some tips to effectively use the above CodePen:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Toggle the actual display of the player by clicking the <strong>Result</strong> button.</li>
      <li>Click the <strong>HTML/CSS/JS</strong> buttons to display ONE of the code types.</li>
      <li>Click <strong>Edit on CodePen</strong> in the upper right corner to fork this CodePen into your own account.</li>

    <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) You can download two versions of our proxy code:</p>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/bcls-proxy-for-distribution.php.zip">This is a general version that expects client credentials to be passed with the request</a></li>
      <li><a href="//learning-services-media.brightcove.com/doc-assets/proxy/doc-samples-proxy.php.zip">This version allows you to save your client credentials in the proxy itself on lines 25-26 (recommended)</a></li>

    <p>In order to build your own version the sample app on this page, you must create and host your own proxy. (The proxies used by Brightcove Learning Services only accept requests from Brightcove domains.) A sample proxy, very similar to the one we use, but without the checks that block requests from non-Brightcove domains, can be found in <a href="https://github.com/BrightcoveLearning/sample-proxy-apps">this GitHub repository</a>. You will also find basic instructions for using it there, and a more elaborate guide to building apps around the proxy in <a href="/getting-started/learning-guide-using-rest-apis.html">Using the REST APIs</a>.</p>
